Robert Pritchard Portfolio Readme:

Notes: There is a LinkedIn badge at the bottom of the Bio page, below the resume download. I have tested it with Chrome and Safari. For some reason I donâ€™t know, the badge only displays on Safari about 75% of the time. 

Extra Credit:

Form:
I created a form on the Contact page. It contains two types of input, text and checkbox. There is form validation in the email input box. Once you submit the form, a dialog message is displayed.

External Content LinkedIn Badge:
The LinkedIn badge would be useful for users interesting in my qualifications and want to find out more. The LinkedIn badge will automatically display the bio of my LinkedIn page along with my current organization that I have put on LinkedIn. Users know they can see my most recent information and not hope my resume/bio is up to date. They can also use a link to visit my LinkedIn.

External Content Google Calendar:
The Google Calendar is included under my contact information and contact form. If someone wanted to contact and schedule an appointment with me, they could get an idea of how soon and what times I would be available. Also, it could let someone who is reaching out with an opportunity know if I have time for it.
