Robert Pritchard Portfolio Readme:

Notes: The LinkedIn API is terrible and for some reason Github can't handle it either, so I need to add 2 disclaimers.
        1. For some reason, the LinkedIn badge breaks the github hosted page's CSS on Google Chrome. It works locally with Google Chrome. It also works on            Github pages using Safari or Firefox. I checked the insept element console, there are no erros. I have no idea why this happens, so I decided to            remove the LinkedIn badge from the Github hosted page. I attached a picture in this repository called "linkedinBadgeWorking.png". This is what I            see when I run the webpage locally or on a different browser. I commeneted out the code pertaining to the linkedin badge in bio.html, so you can inspect the HTML code there . I understand if I can't get the extra credit for this part, I just figured it was worth a shot.
        2. For another reason I don't fully understand, sometimes the LinkedIn badge doesn't show up at all. If you check the inspect element console and it says there was an error with a request sent to the LinkedIn API. There isn't a lot of information about why this happens. I believe it has something to do with me having LinkedIn open on my computer. I don't know. You can also reference "linkedinBadgeWorking.png" if this error occurs. I apologize for all this trouble, I wish I had looked into this sooner and I could have figured it out.

Extra Credit:

Form:
I created a form on the Contact page. It contains two types of input, text and checkbox. There is form validation in the email input box. Once you submit the form, a dialog message is displayed.

External Content LinkedIn Badge:
The LinkedIn badge would be useful for users interesting in my qualifications and want to find out more. The LinkedIn badge will automatically display the bio of my LinkedIn page along with my current organization that I have put on LinkedIn. Users know they can see my most recent information and not hope my resume/bio is up to date. They can also use a link to visit my LinkedIn.

External Content Google Calendar:
The Google Calendar is included under my contact information and contact form. If someone wanted to contact and schedule an appointment with me, they could get an idea of how soon and what times I would be available. Also, it could let someone who is reaching out with an opportunity know if I have time for it.
